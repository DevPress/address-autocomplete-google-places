== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I get a Google Places API Key? =

You will need to sign up for a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account. Then [create an API key following these instructions](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/get-api-key).

= Does Google Places autocomplete cost money? =

If your usage exceeds the credit amount, this service does cost money. See this page for the [latest pricing](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/usage-and-billing#places-details).

Place Details charges start at .017 USD per autocomplete session (or $17 per 1000 sessions).

This plugin only requests data needed to autofill address results which keeps costs at a minimum.

= Why should I use this plugin over others? =

I built this plugin after trying a number of other ones that didn't work great. Some made inefficent API calls which resulted in additional costs. Some had bugs which caused address results to be provided for countries that were not available. Others had additional features like maps, which weren't needed.

This plugin does one thing, and it does it well.
